    "**Output Derived Attributes**\n",

    "Merging tables refers to joining together two or more tables that have\n",

    "one table with information about each store's general characteristics (e.g.,\n",
    "floor space, type of mall), another table with summarized sales data (e.g.,\n",
    "profit, percent change in sales from previous year), and another with\n",
    "information about the demographics of the surrounding area. Each of\n",

    "merged together into a new table with one record for each store,\n",
    "combining fields from the source tables.\n",
    "Merged data also covers aggregations. Aggregation refers to operations\n",
    "where new values are computed by summarizing together information\n",
    "from multiple records and/or tables. For example, converting a table of\n",
    "customer purchases where there is one record for each purchase into a\n",
    "new table where there is one record for each customer, with fields such\n",
    "as number of purchases, average purchase amount, percent of orders\n",

    "**Task Format Data**\n",

    "the modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Reformatted Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools have requirements on the order of the attributes, such as the\n",
    "first field being a unique identifier for each record or the last field being\n",
    "the outcome field the model is to predict.\n",
    "It might be important to change the order of the records in the dataset.\n",
    "Perhaps the modeling tool requires that the records be sorted according to\n",
    "the value of the outcome attribute. Most common situation is that the\n",
    "records of the dataset are initially ordered in some way but the modeling\n",
    "algorithm needs them to be in a fairly random order. For example, when\n",
    "using neural networks it is generally best for the records to be presented\n",
    "in a random order although some tools will hand this automatically\n",
    "without explicit user intervention.\n",
    "Additionally, there are purely syntactic changes made to satisfy the\n",
    "requirements of the specific modeling tool. Examples: removing commas\n",
    "from within text fields in comma-delimited data files, trimming all values\n",
    "to a maximum of 32 characters."
