    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze the PISA database, a database in the education sector, and find correlations that explain some student behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a list of suggested questions, we started with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Profile of repeating students in PISA. What variables contribute to explaining their performance in mathematics? How has it evolved over the various assessment cycles?\n",
    "2) What pedagogical strategies developed by teachers seem to promote better reading performance (PISA 2018 - teacher context data)? And what pedagogical strategies, according to the students' perspective, seem to promote better reading performance (PISA 2018 - student context data)? Do teachers and students have the same perceptions?\n",
    "3) Profile of students in vocational and professional courses in PISA. What variables contribute to explaining their performance in mathematics? How has it evolved over the various assessment cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Success Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured by the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Identification of key data Features**: Successfully identify and document the data key features contributing to repeating students and mathematics performance. This includes understanding how these variables have evolved over various assessment cycles.\n",
    "- **Success Indicator**: A comprehensive report detailing the identified variables and their impact on student performance, reviewed and validated by educational experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Evaluation of Pedagogical Strategies**: Analyze and compare the pedagogical strategies developed by teachers and perceived by students that promote better reading performance. Determine if there are any discrepancies between teacher and student perceptions.\n",
    "- **Success Indicator**: A detailed analysis report highlighting effective pedagogical strategies with recommendations for educators. This report should be peer-reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Profile Analysis of Vocational and Professional Students**: Develop a detailed profile of students based on their questionnaire answers, identifying variables that contribute to their mathematics performance and tracking their evolution over various assessment cycles.\n",
    "- **Success Indicator**: A thorough profile report that provides insights into the performance of vocational and professional students, validated by educational stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Actionable Insights**:Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the findings to help improve educational strategies and student performance.\n",
    "- **Success Indicator**: A set of actionable recommendations presented to educational authorities and stakeholders, with feedback indicating their usefulness and potential for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Ensure that the findings and recommendations are deemed useful and insightful by the stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, academic researchers, data analysts and machine learning developers\n",
    "- **Success Indicator**: Positive feedback from stakeholders through surveys or interviews, indicating that the project has provided valuable insights and practical recommendations.\n"
