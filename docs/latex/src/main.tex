% \section{Methods}
% %%\label{}

% \subsection{Stacking}
% Stacking is an ensemble learning technique developed by \cite{WOLPERT1992241} that combines several prediction models and uses their outputs as input for a next-level model (meta-model), aiming to improve overall prediction performance\cite{Stacking}. In the study \cite{Stacking}, the authors divide stacking into level 0 and level 1, where layer 0 refers to where the different models generate distinct predictions, and level 1 combines predictions of level 0. For level 0, some of the different models that could be used are DTs, NNs, SVMs, and kNN, in which the resulting predictions are then used and combined in layer 1, in order to improve the overall prediction \cite{WOLPERT1992241}, the authors choose to use ridge regression, which can be useful to avoid overfitting \cite{CUI2021107038}
% \subsection{Boosting}
% Because the dataset used in this study is composed of missing data, it is imperative to implement learners that deal with missing data, the boosting algorithms used were XGBoost, HGB, and LightGBM \cite{Stacking}
% \subsection{blending}
% Blending and stacking are both techniques used in ensemble learning that share similarities. The key difference between them is that in blending, the base learners are trained using predictions obtained from the validation set instead of directly from the training set\cite{Stacking}
% \section{Results}
% The study found that the stacking method produced the lowest error metrics (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)) for most countries compared to boosting and blending. Robust linear mixed-effects models indicated that stacking had significantly lower error metrics across all subjects as showed in \ref{fig:results}.

%   \label{fig:results}
% \end{figure}

% \section{Conclusion}
% The study \cite{Stacking} concludes that stacking is a favorable option for better performance, stable and accurate predictions based on evaluation with various metrics such as MAPE, MAE, MSE and RMSE where it obtained a significant metric score in all subjects compared to boosting and blending.
% Due to this study only evaluating the PISA dataset, I think it would be interesting to evaluate it with other datasets to improve this analysis further
